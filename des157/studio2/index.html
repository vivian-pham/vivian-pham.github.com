            <div class="memory" id="pokemoncard">Memory: First car accident I was in was when I was 6 years old. 
            My 9 year old cousin Johnny was in the back seat with me when it happened. He was picking on me and trying to swindle rare Pokemon cards from me.
            We were about to trade cards when suddenly we felt a sudden impact behind us and watched as the car who hit us make a 3-point turn and drive away.
            I was confused but didn't think anything bad was going to happen, that is, until my cousin told me I'll never see my parents again and that I'd be an orphan. So of course I started crying and shortly after he did too.
            Before we knew it our parents came to pick us up and we watched as some nice bystanders push the car to the side of the street. They were never able to identify the hit and runners.
            That day I learned that there are both nice and mean people - my cousin was grouped into the mean people.</div>

            <div class="memory" id="cheetos">Memory: My mom was taking me to visit my cousins house after school with a new car we bought a week ago. I brought a bag of chips for my after school snack that I wanted to share with my cousins. 
            Before we got there, the car in the lane next to us swerved into our car and rammed the side of the car I was sitting at. 
            The other driver proceeded to yell at my mom and with the language barrier I had to translate at 8 years old. I didn't have time to process the pain of the impact. 
            Our car got towed away and I ended up staying on the side of the road eating Hot Cheetos with my mom until we got picked up. 
            I'll always remember the mean lady who yelled at us and the anger and sadness I felt for my mom. Hot Cheetos never hit the same again.</div>

            Significance: My first accident as a driver</br>
            Year: 2015</br>
            Category: T-Bone<br></br>
            Memory: I got a brand new car for my 18th birthday as a graduation gift. It only lasted a year until I totaled it. 
            I had just gotten into a big fight with my parents before starting my first day at my new job in downtown Sacramento. 
            I was overwhelmed with emotions post-argument and was also running late to work from the fight. Focusing on directions from Google maps, 
            I tried to ignore the fear I had of driving the unfamilar roads downtown. When faced with a two way stop in front of me, I made sure to look both ways.
            But unknowingly to me, there was a car headed towards me at the same time. They had the right of way and tried to speed past by me but it was too late as I was already halfway through the intersection.
            My car crashed into the front of the other drivers and I heard the loud screeching of metal as the entire front of my car scraped the road beneath it. I broke down and cried from everything that was going on, I didn't know what to do or who to call. 
            Luckily a kind lady who happened to come back from church saw the accident and offered me a hand. She helped deal with all the logistics and emotions I had. She handed me her inhaler, a tangerine, water bottle and bandaids- things she happened to have in her purse. 
            While we waited for the police, I unloaded all my problems to her while she peeled the tangerine for me and she told me that things will get better.
            I don't know what I would've done without the kindness of that stranger but because of her tangerines became a source of comfort for me.

        <h2>RIP: Toyota Corolla 2016</h2>
        <p> Driver: Me</br>
            Significance: Most recent (and scariest) accident</br>
            Year: 2017</br>
            Category: Rear-End<br></br>
            Memory: From the insurance money from my last accident, I was able to get another new car. With the opportunity and chance at another new car, I knew I had it better than most and didn't want to take it for granted.
            Unfortunately, I always happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time too often and also totaled this car. It was a random thursday afternoon and I was heading to campus for class. 
            After searching around for almost 20 minutes to all the different parking lots and garages on campus, I couldn't find a spot and decided to give up and go home since I lived 10 min away.
            I've driven the route on the highway from campus to my apartment over a hundred times and was too familiar with the route. This may have been a bad thing though, because I noticed that there was more traffic than usual.
            I decided to be nosy and rubberneck to see what was going on in front of me. I saw a line of cars and their rear break lights turn red one by one when it hit me that everyone was slamming their breaks. 
            Before I had time to react, I knew what was going to happen and knew it was too late to stop. The only reaction I was capable of having was muttering an "oh shi---" as I slammed my breaks and rear-ended the truck in front of me. 
            While I didn't have the "life flashing before my eyes moment" that everyone talks about on TV, I did see a flash of white light as I closed my eyes and braced myself for what was to come.
            Thankfully I made it out with minor injuries but I knew that again, I messed up and the car was beyond repair. Trying to pull over on the side of the busy highway, I saw my car's engine drop and smoke come out. Ignoring my pain I limped away from my car and said my goodbyes.
            What shocked me the most from this experience was that the extent of damage to the truck I hit, was just the chips of the paint and small pieces from my car on their license plate.
