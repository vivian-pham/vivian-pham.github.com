       <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
       <p>In order to get the best results from your users, it is important to pay attention to a form's usability
           as an aspect of design itself. You should make the experience of filling out forms as clear, concise, and enjoyable
           as you can for your users to get the best results. This can be through your directions, placeholder texts, formatting instructions,
           security and privacy, and message responses and feedback. It's also important to note the accessibility level on not just your site but your form as well.
           Although it is important to get as much information you can from your users, you want to avoid cognitive load by reducing the number of fields and steps in your process. 
        Filling out forms tend to be a tedious task but following the best practices for form design can help bring you more responses and traffic to reach your goal.
        After reading this article, I was able to dissect the different aspects of forms and the detail that should be placed on creating a better experience in all aspects.
