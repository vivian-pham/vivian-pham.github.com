            <h3>Uses of Images and Interaction</h3>
            <p>The power of imagery and images expands beyond the immediate visual presence. What our viewers and users see at a first glance just touches the surface level of visual design.
                 Being able to look deeper and closer at images can further highlight the intention you wish to provide; it can support an interaction or key themes that need to be emphasized. 
                Taking a look at once example from <a href="https://recruit.cas.softbank.jp/">Softbank Japan</a>, one can see that their message "chase the future" is encaptured by moving interactions 
                and imagery behind it. Using black and white photos takes away the distraction of colors and allows the viewers to focus on the subjects of the images. The quick short transition 
                of the images parallels the frantic and quick "chase" that is emphasized in their message. Combining the interaction of the message and photos further supports the company's message and 
                better immerses the users as an experience itself. Normally, images are static to allow better observation and attention to what is captured, but my showing quick movements, the images 
                further support the limit time to encapture each image.

            <h3>Overuse of Overlays</h3>
            <p>Learning about overlays and the Do's and Dont's helped me better understand its importance in a design aspect. An insighful method to determine
                whether or not lightboxes are appropriate are the 5 W's- who, what, when, where, and why, which I will go through and 
                ask myself the next time I include a lightbox. I recently worked with a client who used overlays as a giant message board that required scrolling to read the entirety 
                of its contents; I knew it wasn't a best practice but wasn't sure how to explain it but this article clarified a lot of the reasonsings behind it. Some important points
                to think about additionally are the audience, the action desired, when and where the overlay appears, if it interrupts anything, and why is it necessary to have it on a 
                lightbox. Although these lightboxes can be a quick and easy way to add additional information, failure to put proper thought and consideration towards its purpose could actually
                lead to bad design and take away from your overall site. Lastly, I learned that it's very important to test your light boxes as well on different platforms to make sure
                that it is functioning properly.

       <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
       <p>In order to get the best results from your users, it is important to pay attention to a form's usability
           as an aspect of design itself. You should make the experience of filling out forms as clear, concise, and enjoyable
           as you can for your users to get the best results. This can be through your directions, placeholder texts, formatting instructions,
           security and privacy, and message responses and feedback. It's also important to note the accessibility level on not just your site but your form as well.
           Although it is important to get as much information you can from your users, you want to avoid cognitive load by reducing the number of fields and steps in your process. 
        Filling out forms tend to be a tedious task but following the best practices for form design can help bring you more responses and traffic to reach your goal.
        After reading this article, I was able to dissect the different aspects of forms and the detail that should be placed on creating a better experience in all aspects.
