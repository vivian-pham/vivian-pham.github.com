    <h1>Project Brief:</h1>
    <p>The aim of this project is to relay a personal history with car accidents through a scroll-interactive website to give the audience insight to the different thoughts and emotions that played out during that experience.</p>

    <h2>Comparison Project 1:</h2>
        <p>One project comparison I found was an interactive website story called <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/" target="_blank">The Boat</a>. This site tells a story of a boat ride which is a vehicle used to tell a story.
        I think the narration and animation, including sounds, created a dynamic environment that allowed me to feel similar emotions to the designer and speaker. The background animation was standard as it's own motion versus the photos and images used in the foreground.
        The backgrounds would change according to each scene and the supporting images were comicbook-like. There are many different layers of positioning to each content piece with adds a great amount of depth and motion to the page.
        Overall, this type of narrative is a heightened experience compared to paper novels and graphics. I think overall, they did an amazing job at using text, positioning, contrast, and motion effects to tell the story.
        I was able to feel the emotion presented in the text and all the elements were done so in a supporting way. I don't really see any areas that could be improved in this.</p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 2:</h2>
        <p>Another project comparison I chose <a href="http://www.spokespedicabs.com/" target="_blank">The Spokes: Pedicabs</a>. This one is a bit different from the last in both intention and content. I chose this one because it also uses transportation vehicles as its main subject.
        Compared to the last project I chose to compare, the foreground image and subject is static while the background moves instead. This way you can capture more of the environment that changes upon scroll and the subject remains the same per section. 
        There are also some nice interactive elements that flash to show that the user should click to learn more or text that fades in. Upon click, a popup text box appears giving extra information connected to the setting. 
        I think an area of improvement could be the consistency and uniformity between section and interactive elements. It wasn't until the 3rd visit that I noticed the flashing dots that suggest users to click it because the previous "scenes" didn't have it.
        Possibly having too big of a variety of elements could be confusing for users or left information unread and uninteracted.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
        <p>The goal of my project is to give my audience and readers a glimpse of my history and perspective through events with a touch of my personality. I would like my project to have the same captivating emotions as Comparison 1 but visual style of Comparison 2 for each event.
            My project should set the scene and highlight the emotions felt during each accident through the narrative on scroll and portray the scene of accident with motion. The background of each scene will be dynamic and moving on scroll with the key subject static to be identified.
            Like the other projects, I would like to have interactive elements that reveal more information upon click but will keep it consistent with each scene having one interactive click element. 
        </p>
    <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
        <p>The overall color should have a subtle and soft contrast with elements of dark and brightness to parallel the negative memory and lighthearted associations found. The type will be sans-serif to create a more casual tone than serious or professional.
            Each block of text will be placed in sections to follow gestalt principles of closeness to each prospective scene and story. Sections will have different colored backgrounds to suggest a change in scene.
        </p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
        <p>The interactions will primarily be scroll based but I will also include mouse-click interactions and hovers. Some elements will be animated to draw user's attention and suggest that it is an object that can be interacted with. There will be some
            scroll position based elements that will appear and fade at a certain y-position of the screen. For audio elements, a sound clip will be activated when the user reaches a certain scroll position to signify a crash has happened.
        </p>
    <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
        <p>My goal is for the audience to be able to understand and visualize the emotions, thoughts, and environment during each accident. With enough visual and audio cues, I hope to mimic the impact of an accident but in a more subtle way. With the narrative and placement of the text, 
            I hope that there is enough emotion to fully comprehend each feeling presented and also see the touch of irony at the end of each scene.
