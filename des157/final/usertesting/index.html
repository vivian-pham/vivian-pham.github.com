        <h2>"A STORY OF UNTIMELY LUCK"</h2>
    
        <p>
        Throughout my life, I’ve been in more accidents than I can count with my fingers. While these events are considered quite unlucky, they are part of my story and I’ve learned quite a few lessons from them.
        <br><br>
        I’ve decided to showcase a few memorable examples and share my narrative below.

                Memory: First car accident I was in was when I was 6 years old. 
                My 9 year old cousin Johnny was in the back seat with me when it happened. He was picking on me and trying to swindle rare Pokemon cards from me.
                We were about to trade cards when suddenly we felt a sudden impact behind us and watched as the car who hit us make a 3-point turn and drive away.
                I was confused but didn't think anything bad was going to happen, that is, until my cousin told me I'll never see my parents again and that I'd be an orphan. So of course I started crying and shortly after he did too.
                Before we knew it our parents came to pick us up and we watched as some nice bystanders push the car to the side of the street. They were never able to identify the hit and runners.
                That day I learned that there are both nice and mean people - my cousin was grouped into the mean people.</p>

            Year: 2004</br>
            Category: Side Swipe</br>
            Memory: My mom was taking me to visit my cousins house after school with a new car we bought a week ago. I brought a bag of chips for my after school snack that I wanted to share with my cousins. 
            Before we got there, the car in the lane next to us swerved into our car and rammed the side of the car I was sitting at. 
            The other driver proceeded to yell at my mom and with the language barrier I had to translate at 8 years old. I didn't have time to process the pain of the impact. 
            Our car got towed away and I ended up staying on the side of the road eating Hot Cheetos with my mom until we got picked up. 
            I'll always remember the mean lady who yelled at us and the anger and sadness I felt for my mom. Hot Cheetos never hit the same again.
