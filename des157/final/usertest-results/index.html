    <h1>User Testing Results</h1>

    <h2>To receive insight on my project and its usability, I conducted a user testing session with a few individuals.
        From those tests, I was able to gather a few observations that were revealed during the session.
    </h2>

    <h3>Test 1</h3>

    <p>From my first user test, the biggest observation I had was that the user would try and click on other objects. As shown in the image above the user stopped the scroll to move her mouse over the car and click.
        When there was no interaction from that click, the user continued to focus on scrolling and realized there are no clickable elements. Because of this, I think I will incorporate clickable objects and items near the crash interaction with a popup so the user could be more integrated into the experience.
        I think adding an indicator for a clickable object will be my next step on improving my project.
    </p>

    <h3>Test 2</h3>

    <p>From the second user test, I learned more about user interaction and behavior with the website. I noted the scrolling patterns and speed, especially in regards to getting the animations to start and the time it takes to read the text box.  
        The user did have difficulty reading the text quickly and skipped some text all together. I noted that she scrolled very fast and missed some of the interactions that occured because of the timing in reference to scroll position.
        It was also mentioned that there was too much empty space in some areas and this may have resulted in why she scrolled too quickly. A possible solution to avoid this issue is to add more details to the background street graphics so there are things to look at along the way.
        I will also adjust the css animation timing to have it triggered earlier to lower the chances of missing the interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Test 3</h3>
    <img src="images/Test3.png" width="500px" height="350px" alt="user test screen 3">
    <p>In the third user test, I noted a few things regarding page optimization and sizing. The screen of the website was not optimized to fit the user's screen so the page didn't fit evenly. In the image provided above, 
        you could see how the right side of the main screen has a larger margin compared to the left, this was the default view for the user.
        Additionally, I noticed that he also took a while to read and mentioned how it was a bit harder to read because of how much text there is.
        From these observations and notes, I will focus on creating better balance in the text for readability and better scanning. Breaking the paragraph into chunks is one way I could do that in addition to playing with different line weights.
