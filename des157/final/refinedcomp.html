        <p>After getting feedback, I decided to change up my design with a different approach.
            From Glenda, I got advice on utilizing my spokes website as a reference for the scroll animation so I focused more on that than the first example. I thought that focusing on a scroll example could better portray the different scenes of my accident and personalize it.
            I also paid more attention to Gestalt Principles to apply to my design and focus on proximity, this way it is clear which elements are connected.
            Lastly, the biggest design change was the overall color and look. I wanted a design that ultimately emphasizes the light-hearted approach I have towards my accidents and changed the colors to be more bright and vivid instead of muted and melancholic.
